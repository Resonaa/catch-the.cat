					<b>About the game</b><br>
					This game is inspired by the classic French game Chat Noir,
					adapted from the cultural background of Els Quatre Gats (Catalan for "The Four Cats"）in Catalonia.
					The cat character in the game is based on the European wildcat, a native Catalan feline.<br>

					Due to the increasingly severe ecological challenges brought about by the free-range and
					feralization of domestic cats, the European wildcat faces threats such as invasive species,
					genetic pollution, and habitat fragmentation, and its population is declining rapidly.<br>

					We hope this fun little game could raise awareness and concern for endangered species,
					and encourage people to work together to protect our only home for all humanity.
